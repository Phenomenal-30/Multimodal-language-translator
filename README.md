# Multimodal-language-translator-
Created a language transaltor project with help of Python,django,HTML,CSS,Javascript that converts one language to another.
  We can convert language in 2 ways:-
    1)Text to Text:- In this method we take input as a text and return the output as a text.
    2)Voice to text:- In this method we take input as a voice and return the output as a text.
